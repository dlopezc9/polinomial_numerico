# Audio reconstruction using Linear Regression, Polynomial Segmentation and Splines


## Description

This is our Numerical Analysis investigation project.

This projectâ€™s main purpose is to reconstruct audio in a way that is very approximate to the original track, trying to make the error as small as possible. We used the libraries numpy, statsmodels.api, sklearn and math.


## Execution (Anaconda Prompt)

```sh
$ cd PolinomialInvestigation/Research
$ python main.py
```
